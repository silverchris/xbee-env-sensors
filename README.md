A platform using using [Python-XBee](https://code.google.com/p/python-xbee/) to communicate with simple XBee based wireless sensors.

Supports being directly polled using [Munin](http://munin-monitoring.org) to monitor sensor data.

Support modules need to be created for sensors to handle the data reported by the sensor modules. See TESTSENSOR.py and SensorBase.py for an example.
